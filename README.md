### ReactJS Boilerplate

Boilerplate repo for starting ReactJS apps. Mostly for personal use and sandboxing, though also potentially a nice resource for beginners to get to know React and a lot of the supporting libraries (bootstrap, redux, etc.)

## Features

## Redux

Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.

## ES6

Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more, today.

## SASS

Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity.

## React Reach Router

It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.

## React Bootstrap

Built with compatibility in mind, we embrace our bootstrap core and strive to be compatible with the world's largest UI ecosystem

## How to Start

- Clone the repo https://github.com/sahalea/hello-react.git
